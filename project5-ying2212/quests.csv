My First Backpack,Before beginning our adventure we better find an Adventurer's Backpack for all the gold/loot/trinkets we're going to find!,1,10,NONE,NONE
Enter The Tavern,We have a backpack now! But it is sad and empty. We want Gold! Riches! Happiness! A sure way to obtain 2 of those 3 is to enter the town's tavern.,1,10,My First Backpack,NONE
Explore The Tavern,In our boundless enthusiasm we walked face first into the tavern door because it said Pull and we Pushed. Now all the Tavern inhabitants are looking at us funny. Better strike up some conversations to play it off.,1,10,Enter The Tavern,Talk to the Barkeep;Talk to the Chef;Talk to the Mysterious Figure
Talk to the Chef,So...what are the specials?,1,10,NONE,House Stew
House Stew,The green smoke coming from the stew seem a little suspicious...but adventurers do not shy away from strange ambient animations! Eat the House Stew.,1,20,NONE,NONE
Talk to the Barkeep,Perhaps the Barkeep will have a less sickening quest for us.,1,10,House Stew,Pest Control
Pest Control,The stairs leading down to the Tavern's basement are blocked off with a small wooden sign: Coming Soon! :) The Barkeep has just informed us that the basement is actually suffering from a bad infestation of Verminth – vile and slimy creatures that can be closely compared to giant cursed maggots. As they're in their larval stage – they lack the limbs to climb the stairs...yet. We will need something to poison the Verminth with before attacking them in order to counteract their regenerative abililties.,1,20,NONE,NONE
Talk to the Mysterious Figure,A shrouded figure in the shadowed corner of the Tavern beckons us over with one pale crooked finger. Now THAT sounds like the start of an epic quest!,1,10,House Stew,Lost and Found
Lost and Found,The shrouded figure's name is Jared. Jared wants to form a team to play Troll Toll – the tavern's trivia game. Jared's Very Shiny Trivia Ring fell down the stairs and into the Tavern's basement and he would like it back so that he can beckon more adventurers over to join his team. We must aid him on this noble quest.,0,20,NONE,NONE
The Melodeon,We heard a musical wail from under one of the tavern's tables. We believe it to be the cry of a Melodeon: a magical creature renowned not only for its singing voice but the prophetic qualities of its song. Because of that the songs of Melodeons are highly sought after by many seeking new and exciting adventures or fortune. There are those that trap Melodeons – recognizing that a profit can be made from either Magnates looking to keep a Melodeon as a pet or adventurers willing to pay a coin for a song. We should try to find out more about this Melodeon.,0,30,House Stew;Pest Control;Lost and Found,Talk to Songcatcher;The Melodeon's Song;Great. We Have A Melodeon
Talk to Songcatcher,We found the Melodeon in an ornate cage under a tavern table with its owner close by – Songcatcher. The cage is inscribed with the name: Solstice. We should talk to Songcatcher before getting any closer.,1,10,Explore The Tavern,NONE
The Melodeon's Song,Songcatcher seems to think Solstice is defective. As it turns out: Solstice was purchased as a pair with another Melodeon (Aurora) who was recently sold to the town Magnate. Since then...Solstice has been stuck singing one song: Auroran Sunset. While the Sunset is the name of a luscious and exotic fruit that radiates a golden glow – reminiscent of the intense colors of a sunset – it is clear that the heartbroken Solstice will refuse to sing any other song until it is either reunited with Aurora or able to move on. Songcatcher is eager to get rid of the defective Melodeon and is offering to sell Solstice to you at a great discount. We should accept the offer to see if we can help.,0,20,Explore The Tavern,NONE
Great. We Have A Melodeon,The sale did not include the cage. Solstice leapt into our Adventurer's Backpack and immediately maxed out our inventory space. A pitiful wail emerges from our bag every once in a while. We should try to cheer Solstice up so that he is able to walk on his own and we can free up our inventory again.,0,20,Talk to Songcatcher;The Melodeon's Song,Reunited;Auroran Sunset
Reunited,Every so often: a muffled Solstice chokes out a few lines of his song – Auroran Sunset. The other Melodeon Aurora was sold to the town Magnate who lives in the mansion on the hill. Perhaps we should travel to the mansion to see if the two can be reunited. Our backpack weighs heavily on our shoulders and it leaks a trail of tears behind us.,0,40,Great. We Have A Melodeon,NONE
Auroran Sunset,The Auroran Sunset is an exotic fruit known for its sweetness and mystical properties. Perhaps we can cheer Solstice up by giving him a piece of the fruit – but first we must find it. We can travel to the town square to see if a vendor is selling it. Our backpack weighs heavily on our shoulders and it leaks a trail of tears behind us.,0,40,NONE,NONE
